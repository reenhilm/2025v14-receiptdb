# 2025v14-receiptdb individual end project - portfolio    
  
A receipt database to search existing receipts (JSON objects) within your group's JSON file. Your group is determined by your user role (stored in Clerk as metadata).  
  
## Why?  
  
Family members share one group.  
Demo users have their own group with sample receipts.  
  
Search by:
* Store name  
* Receipt title  
* Category (multiple?)  
* Purchase date  
* Upload date  
* Uploaded by  
* Total price  
* Item price  
* Item title  
  
# Phase 1 (Now):  
Single frontend with a mock backend (reads from a JSON file).  
Fast to build, perfect for the course timeline.  
  
# Phase 2 (Future - Personal Project):  
Real backend for full functionality.  
Why? Because Iâ€™ll actually use this appâ€”making it more motivating to work on in my free time.  
Excited to expand this into a full-stack showcaseâ€”proving to show I'm actually a backend guy.  
  
Goal: Build something useful, then improve & expandâ€”not just another demo. ðŸš€
